"Currently, standard roadside testing in France is performed in oral fluid OF using an on-site immunological screening for drugs of abuse DOA, specifically the Drugwipe-5S from Securetec OF screening test for ecstasy/amphetamine, opiates, cocaine and cannabis. In 2016 1 and in 2017 2, we tested French and Belgian drivers’ OF samples for new psychoactive substances NPS after a positive or negative roadside screening test for DOA. Here, we complete these data by updated results in French drivers’ OF sampled in 2018, 2019 and 2020. OF samples consisted of dried saliva spots collected from used Drugwipe-5S tests. These roadside immunochemical tests for DOA were performed in drivers’ OF in the North of France area of Lille population of about one million, 1/67th of the total French population, after unannounced roadside tests: roadside test mainly performed after a traffic offence or sometimes <5% decided by a police officer owing to the suspicious attitude of the driver. Anonymously collected after a positive or negative roadside screening test, these devices were broken down. Two of the three OF collection pads of each test were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry LC–MS-MS and high-resolution mass spectrometry LC–HRMS, following previously reported methods 1–4. The LC–MS-MS and LC–HRMS in-house libraries used in these analytical processes were continually improved, containing 440 NPS and related metabolites at the beginning of 2016 and 670 at the end of 2020. Results from 2016 to 2020 are summarized in Table I. These results have obvious limitations: i only drivers who were submitted to a roadside drug testing with a limited and random sampling leading to results that cannot be extrapolated to the complete drivers population, let alone the entire country’s population;; ii stability issues of NPS in OF collection pads 5; iii questionable sensitivity of NPS detection in OF. Notwithstanding these biases, a decrease in NPS prevalence from 3% in 2016 to 1.7% in 2020 is observed. However, the interpretation of the evolution with these low percentage values is limited due to the heterogeneity of the sampling methods variable location and time of collection between years. Nevertheless, similar to Southern Germany where an NPS prevalence rate of 1.6% in blood samples was found in 2017–2018 6, this somewhat low prevalence rate in 2020 suggests that driving under the influence of NPS still does not play a large role in Northern France. When considering the relatively short turnover time of NPS enter and disappear from the drug market at a fast pace, it is of note that this German study 6 is the only one with regard to the period after 2015, as the other previously published studies also based on blood or urine analysis focusing on the prevalence of NPS in cases of impaired driving 7–10 are older. In the general population, use of NPS remains low in European countries: NPS represented 5% of all drugs submitted for testing by individuals to drug checking services operating in 11 European countries during the first half of 2019 11. Identified NPS in these French drivers’ OF from North of France seem to be progressively sliding toward cathinone derivatives, which become dominant in 2019 and 2020. This contrasts with the results in German divers’ blood, wherein synthetic cannabinoids were found in 12 of the 14 positive cases for NPS in 2017 and 2018 6. But, beyond numerous questions on comparability between these two sets of results e.g., detection windows, these two studies exhibit NPS classes prevalence in compliance with observed trends in the general population. Indeed, NPS seizures were dominated in the EU in 2018 by these two NPS classes, which together accounted for 64% of all seizures reported for EU member states: 36% for cathinone derivatives and 28% for synthetic cannabinoids. In 2019, among samples sold as NPS in the EU, the most commonly detected substances were stimulants, primarily cathinone derivatives 11. Among other detected NPS, the detection case of benzoylfentanyl Table I.

Even if lysergic acid diethylamide LSD is not a new psychoactive substance, we decided to consider LSD detection cases in this driving under the influence context. Indeed, a renewed interest for LSD has been observed since several years, which is probably linked to the popularity of some hallucinogenic NPS such as NBOMes 12. Moreover, i LSD is not detected by standard roadside testing, ii its intake can seriously impair driving ability and iii its detection in OF is not usually reported in literature. These two positive LSD cases consist 1 for the first case in 2017, in OF positive for LSD and THC, and 2 for the second one in 2020, in OF positive for LSD, THC and 3-fluorophenmetrazine 3-FPM, a stimulant of the morpholine class 13. Driving under the influence of NPS can only be revealed after additional analytical screening procedures that are performed specifically in order to identify possible NPS intake e.g., when standard DOA assays revealed negative results in the case of obvious impaired driving. This longitudinal survey highlights the reality of driving after NPS use in drivers from the North of France in the past 5 years. Nevertheless, because these data target drivers who were subjected to roadside drug testing following obvious or suspected driving impairments, the assessed prevalence of driving under NPS is certainly limited in the overall driver population."
